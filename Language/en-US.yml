  STR_BRITISH_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Our success during Operation Morning Star resulted in the elimination of enemy forces in the British Isles, and the British are eager to join our cause. They have authorized select volunteers from elite units such as the Royal Marine Commandos and Paratroopers to integrate with our troops, forming the {ALT}Ghost Team{ALT}."

  STR_BRITISH_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "British Cooperation II"
  STR_BRITISH_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Further talks with the British have granted us access to additional equipment. We also received the blueprints for the Razor energy rifle, an improved model of the Chimeran infantry weapon. Captured Bullseyes can now be converted into Razors with the addition of refined Gray Tech components."

  STR_MAQUIS_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Maquis Cooperation I"
  STR_MAQUIS_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Although we have not established formal diplomacy with the Maquis, the European resistance group, we previously collaborated with their predecessor, the United European Defense. SRPA officers such as Colonel James Grayson have worked with them to track and recover alien assets. By providing much needed aid, they agreed to send volunteers, many equipped with their own weapons, in exchange for resources. They now form the {ALT}Fantasma Team{ALT}."

  STR_MAQUIS_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Maquis Cooperation II"
  STR_MAQUIS_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The initial hesitation from the Maquis may have been due to the Grace Administration ending the lend-lease program originally introduced by President Roosevelt. Our renewed collaboration has been successful, and we now have access to a wider range of weaponry for our task force. Furthermore, we can begin producing the prototype Longbow railgun using captured Gray Tech."

  STR_EXTENDING_WIDEBAND_TRANSMISSIONS: "Extending Wideband Transmissions"
  STR_EXTENDING_WIDEBAND_TRANSMISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Work continues to expand the range of our listening posts. We are convinced that human forces remain active elsewhere in the world; we just need to find them. Field engineers have begun integrating recovered Gray Tech transceivers into existing SRPA arrays, drastically improving atmospheric penetration and reducing interference from Chimeran jamming. Each new signal we capture may represent another surviving enclave waiting to reconnect."

  STR_JAPANESE_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Japanese Cooperation I"
  STR_JAPANESE_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "By dedicating additional resources to scanning the Pacific for human transmissions, we intercepted a signal from the SRPA Japanese Corps, long presumed missing in action. They reported continued combat on the Asian mainland and several incursions over the Japanese Home Islands. We agreed to provide assistance, and in return, elite Imperial Navy and Army units have joined our task force. They now serve as {ALT}Yokai Team{ALT}."

  STR_JAPANESE_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Japanese Cooperation II"
  STR_JAPANESE_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Our cooperation with the Japanese defenders has proven effective. Some concerns remain among SRPA command due to the Imperial leadership’s past expansionist stance, which was not well-received during the Roosevelt Administration. Nevertheless, the alliance has proven strategically sound. The Japanese SRPA division has also shared new weapon schematics based on Gray Tech, and we are now able to reproduce them in our facilities."

  STR_CODEBREAKER_TRANSMISSIONS: "Codebreaker Transmissions"
  STR_CODEBREAKER_TRANSMISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "After detecting faint radio waves from Russia, we repositioned all available listening posts toward that region to confirm signs of life.

  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Russian Cooperation I"
  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "We have established a consistent communication link with remnants of the Russian Imperial Army in several sectors, including Sevastopol, Leningrad, and the Caspian Sea. The Maquis have offered to act as intermediaries, although caution is advised given the lingering distrust between both sides. Thirty years of political animosity cannot be undone in mere months. Nonetheless, they have agreed to provide volunteers equipped with their own gear in exchange for supplies and technical assistance. They now form the {ALT}Prizrak Team{ALT}."

  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Russian Cooperation II"
  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The Russians fighting alongside us have proven exceptionally resourceful, with tactics and field strategies refined over decades of constant warfare against the Chimera. Many expressed gratitude for finally having access to proper supplies after years of guerrilla-style combat with minimal equipment. In reciprocity, they shared blueprints for a reverse-engineered energy rifle based on a captured Chimeran prototype. We can now produce it in our own workshops using Gray Tech components."

  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Siberian Cooperation I"
  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "A hidden enclave of Imperial Army survivors was discovered in the Far East, near the Alaskan frontier. Their continued survival despite decades of Chimera infestation across the Siberian wastelands is remarkable. We offered military support and modern equipment to aid their resistance efforts. In return, several veteran soldiers have volunteered to join our organization. They now serve as {ALT}Fantom Team{ALT}."

  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Siberian Cooperation II"
  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Years of isolation deep within the Siberian wilderness have made the Guards deeply distrustful of outsiders, even fellow humans. After gaining their confidence, they provided us with templates of their custom-built 'Grom' rifle, an early Bullseye-derived prototype. Using modern refinements and additional Gray Tech components, we can now enhance and reproduce this lost design for use in our own operations."

  STR_ELERIUM_115: "Nuclear Reactor Fuel"
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "Highly radioactive elements stored within a stabilized containment chamber. Direct exposure without specialized protection is hazardous, though controlled handling shows no adverse effects so far. Some samples form crystalline patterns that glow brightly under ultraviolet light. SRPA engineers suggest this compound could be an early experimental fuel precursor to modern fusion reactor designs."

  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE: "Alien Nuclear Reactor"
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The Chimera use compact nuclear reactors to power both their installations and vehicles. While humanity mastered fission decades ago, their technology operates at levels of efficiency and stability far beyond our own. Understanding their reactor containment methods could transform Earth's approach to clean and sustainable energy production."

  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS: "Chimera Steel"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "A lightweight composite alloy widely used by the Chimera in weapon systems, armor plating, and construction materials. It can be shaped easily during production yet remains almost indestructible once solidified. The first samples were recovered by RAF personnel in Gibraltar, but the report detailing its potential uses was intercepted by rogue Maquis agents and lost for years. Its rediscovery has reignited interest in hybrid alloy research under SRPA oversight."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_ITEM: "Gray Tech Item"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_ITEM_UFOPEDIA: "A mysterious and powerful artifact of alien design that does not match any known Chimera engineering. It radiates fluctuating electromagnetic fields and emits swirling thermal distortion, described by scientists as 'shimmering air.' Handling requires protective suits and remote tools. SRPA theorists believe these artifacts may originate from a civilization older than the Chimera."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_RECOVERY_TEAM: "Recovery and Salvage Operations"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_RECOVERY_TEAM_UFOPEDIA: "“Gray Tech” artifacts are often discovered deep within enemy territory, hidden inside major Chimera fortresses and redoubts. To recover these assets for our technological advancement, we must launch targeted raids and extraction operations. The Chimera also appear to collect them, though their purpose remains unclear. To prevent their advantage, Major Richard Blake, authorized directly by President McCullen, has formed an elite unit dedicated to infiltration, recovery, and protection of Gray Tech assets. This new SRPA task force has been designated the {ALT}Spectre Team{ALT}."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_INTRODUCTION: "Gray Tech Introduction"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "“Gray Tech” (GT) is a term coined by Dr. Fyodor Malikov to describe a newly identified category of alien artifacts apparently created by a third, previously unknown faction. Preliminary analysis suggests these items bear no relation to standard Chimera design. Further research is necessary to determine their origin, stability, and potential applications in the war effort."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_THEORY: "Gray Tech Theory"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: "Emerging research suggests that Gray Tech exhibits unique physical and energetic properties capable of amplifying power output when integrated into existing systems. Each artifact acts as an energy conduit, transmitting massive electrical currents that intensify when additional pieces are linked. Continued study may allow us to adapt this amplification into practical battlefield enhancements for our troops and equipment."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_APPLICATIONS: "Gray Tech Applications"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_APPLICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Sustained investigation has yielded the first tangible results for military adaptation. When carefully merged with existing human-designed energy weapons, small fragments of Gray Tech produce significant increases in efficiency, accuracy, and destructive potential. This discovery lays the foundation for developing advanced field weaponry and possibly large-scale craft energy systems. Research on recovered samples must continue to unlock their full potential."

  STR_PROJECT_PROMETHEUS: "Project Prometheus"
  STR_PROJECT_PROMETHEUS_UFOPEDIA: "Dr. Julia Cathcart has assumed leadership of the advanced Gray Tech research program. She theorizes that each individual item may be part of a larger mechanism or machine due to the measurable increase in electromagnetic resonance when multiple units are brought into proximity. The implications of a unified origin are profound, warranting further deep analysis of their structure and harmonic frequency behavior."

  STR_PROMETHEUS_WEAPON: "Prometheus Weapon"
  STR_PROMETHEUS_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "Dr. Cathcart's team achieved a breakthrough confirming that each Gray Tech fragment functions as a modular component within a larger construct. The amplified electromagnetic output generated by clustering multiple units can reach levels capable of triggering catastrophic energy release. By assembling {ALT}100 pieces{ALT}, we could create a powerful device capable of disrupting the entire Chimera hub network. Intelligence suggests that Daedalus, the enemy leader, may be pursuing a similar objective to annihilate humanity.

# LORE


  STR_JET_POWER_LORE: "Jet Power"
  STR_JET_POWER_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Germany put a strong emphasis on newer and better propulsion methods for aircraft. The fear of high-altitude Russian bombers led to the development of Me-262, the first successful jet-powered fighter. Officially deployed  in 1942, it became the premier interceptor force of the UED. Soon after, the British and Americans rushed their own projects, but were always behind the Luftwaffe's designs. The era of the piston-powered aircrafts was coming to an end."

  STR_FALLEN_KNIGHTS_LORE: "Fallen Knights"
  STR_FALLEN_KNIGHTS_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Despite the German air prowess, most of the Luftwaffe and the European air forces were quickly destroyed with the initial stages of the Chimeran onslaught. In the East, many pilots didn't even get to board their planes, as Spire missiles blanketed all the military bases they found on their pass. Western European squadrons fared slightly better and some air victories were scored over the Benelux. UED fighter wings were decimated by the extensive numbers of Chimeran combat crafts. The so-called 'Knights of the Air' were reduced to molten wrecks."

  STR_UED_FORCES_LORE: "UED Forces"
  STR_UED_FORCES_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "The bulk of the United European Defense forces were composed of French, Polish, Germans and Italians, plus reduced brigades from smaller countries. Equipped with German cutting-edge equipment, it was trained to fend off Russian mass-wave attacks. However, the UED's reliance on static defenses and trench warfare ala Great War made it poorly suited to the Chimeran mechanized breakthroughs. Political infighting and low morale shattered the alliance even before the enemy reached their borders."


  STR_ACES_HIGH_LORE: "Aces High"
  STR_ACES_HIGH_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Opposed to most European powers, the Royal Air Force focused primarily on a large fleet of efficient Kingfisher VTOLs to project airpower further inland. Despite being in development since 1937, it was only after the announcement of the Me-262 in the '42 that the Fighter Command opted to replace its fleet of Spitfires with the Meteor. Although slower and less armed than most of its peers, the Gloster-made fighter had a longer operational range. As most were lost in sorties over Czechoslovakia in support of the Bratislava Line, the last remaining few were engaged in air defense on Britain."

  STR_MAGNIFICENT_LIGHTNING_LORE: "Magnificent Lightning"
  STR_MAGNIFICENT_LIGHTNING_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Despite the lack of sufficient aerial opposition during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy requested the development of a high-performance, high-altitude combat craft with the explicit purpose of engaging enemy bombers. The need to protect the main islands from foreign aggression motivated the project. The result was the J7W Shinden, a heavily armored and up-gunned craft. When the Chimera began pushing towards the Far East, even the Mitsubishi 'Zero' fighters struggled to keep the enemy crafts at bay and the Shinden became the elite naval interceptor."


  STR_EURO_AMERICAN_COLLABORATION_LORE: "Euro-American Collaboration"
  STR_EURO_AMERICAN_COLLABORATION_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "During the Roosevelt administration, there was a notorious diplomatic approach between the European organizations and the US. This led to several technological and technical agreements between both blocs, among them the “Strategic Ammunition Standardization Agreement (SATANAG)”, where the .303 British round was adopted as the general small arms chambering for all service rifles. Also, SRPA and MDC exchanged blueprints and research. This eventually became less public during the Grace Administration, as the diplomatic ties were strained with the growing US isolationism."

Given it's unimaginable importance, it is extremely well protected; in fact, no one has ever got within 1,200 yards of the tower… except for Dr. Malikov, who managed to extract a Pure Chimera DNA sample directly in situ."

  STR_THE_SIBERIAN_GUARD: "The Siberian Guard"
  STR_THE_SIBERIAN_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "The Guard was established sometime in the early 40s, shortly after the fall of Imperial Russia and is often considered to be the last remnants of resistance in the Russian Far East. The Guard consists of three military bases spread out across Siberia, along with a single coastal village in the Pacific shoreline known as 'Provideniya', which houses several thousand Russian survivors. They take pride in being the sole protector of Siberia and have proven that through its ruthless guerrilla campaign against the Chimera."

Instead of leaving for Alaska, Sablin and his crew choose to stay and fight for the Motherland. He quickly began to rise through the ranks and establish himself as leader after the untimely demise of the division's commanding officer. He would soon officially form the 'Siberian Guard'"

  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_1: "Operationi Kerensky"
  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_1_UFOPEDIA: "The operation, named after Premier Kerensky, was put in action in April 10th, 1930 as it became clear to the Russian Government that the military wouldn't be able to withstand the Chimera. It authorized the systematic evacuation of civilians into the islands of Sevemaya Zemlya, Novaya Zemlya, Wrangel Island and the New Siberian Islands. The evacuation was mostly handled by the Navy, with a minor role of the Russian Imperial Air Force."

  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_2: "Operationi Kerensky"
  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_2_UFOPEDIA: "Around 1,500,000 people were successfully extracted with operations still taking place as late as 1936. Despite escaping the Chimera, those who were evacuated didn't fare much better, as supply lines began to break down in 1937; a major shortage of food, medicine and other supplies caused famine and disease to run rampant in the poorly constructed camps that the refugees had been placed into."

  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_1_UFOPEDIA: "Named after Chief Executive of the Secret Police, Genrikh Yagoda, was put into place some time after 1937 to prevent the Chimera from infecting anymore of the Russian population and eventually transforming them into the alien species. This would be done through humane termination of any civilians believed to be infected by the virus."

  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_2: "The Yagoda Solution"
  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_2_UFOPEDIA: "This would also extend to any civilian in enemy territory and eventually entire refugee camps if they were deemed too difficult to protect. The mass killings caused heavy distrust and even fear between the Russian people and the military. The Yagoda Solution would remain in effect from 1937 until the end of the war, resulting in nearly 4 million deaths and would be unsuccessful in stopping the Chimera."
