After signing a special disclosure contract, they were inducted into the team. Additional weaponry was requested as well to be able to equip the newcomers. We need as many hands and rifles in the field as possible."

  STR_CODEBREAKER_TRANSMISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "After we got word of faint radio waves coming from Russia, we focused all our available listening posts towards that geographical zone in order to gather any sign of life. After several tries, we caught not one but two signals, on opposite sides of the country. We could choose any of both to begin diplomatic talks."

  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Russian Cooperation I"
  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "We have established a stable link with Russian Imperial Army remnants in several sectors. They seem to be grouped around Sevastopol, Leningrad and the Caspian Sea. The Maquis had offered to provide a liaison between them and our forces, although we are wary of the distrust between each party… you can not erase 30 years of animosity in a couple of months, after all. Despite this, they have agreed on providing volunteers with their equipment in exchange for supplies and tech. They are now part of {ALT}Prizrak Team{ALT}."

  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Russian Cooperation II"
  STR_RUSSIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The Russians fighting alongside us have proven to be resourceful in tactics and strategy. They have been fighting the Chimera since 1927, after all. Many have thanked not being limited in ammunition and weaponry, as they were forced to wage a guerrilla war with barely equipment the last decade. For this reason, they have shared their blueprints for a reverse-engineered energy rifle based on a captured Chimera weapon. We're now able to manufacture it on our workshops, using Gray Tech."

  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH: "Siberian Cooperation I"
  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_1_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "A hidden enclave of Imperial Army remnants was found in the Far East, closer to Alaska. How they managed to remain active after so many years, especially considering how heavily infested are the Siberian wastelands, its almost a miracle. We have offered them military support and equipment to help them in their guerrilla warfare. In turn, several veteran soldiers have volunteered to join our project. They are now part of {ALT}Fantom Team{ALT}."

  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH: "Siberian Cooperation II"
  STR_SIBERIAN_COOPERATION_2_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "So many years of isolation deep in the Siberian forests made the Guards very suspicious of any foreign forces, no matter if they come from their own species. We got their trust and they have allowed us templates of their custom made “Grom” Bullseye-based energy rifle, an older prototype we could improve using modern knowledge and additional Gray Tech."

  STR_ELERIUM_115: "Nuclear Reactor Fuel"
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "Radioactive elements within a containment chamber. Standing near them without special protection may be dangerous, but so far we have not found any issue. Some of them make pretty glassware that is bright under UV light!"

  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE: "Alien Nuclear Reactor"
  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The enemy uses fission technology to power their structures and vehicles. While we were able to achieve said process as well, their technology is far more efficient and sustainable than ours."

  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS: "Chimera steel"
  STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Lightweight steel alloy plating, used by the Chimera to construct a large range of utilities and weaponry. Easily moldable with the right tools, but impervious to all kinds of damage. First found and classified by RAF personnel on Gibraltar, its delivery and intel report on how to use it was intercepted by rouge Maquis agents and became lost until recently."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_ITEM: "Gray Tech Item"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_ITEM_UFOPEDIA: "Exceedingly powerful piece of alien tech. It doesn't correspond to any design made by the Chimera so far. It emits a vibrant light and what could be described as “hot air around it”, most likely radiation. Handle with caution."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_RECOVERY_TEAM: "Recovery and Salvage Operations"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_RECOVERY_TEAM_UFOPEDIA: "The so-called “Gray Tech” is often located behind enemy lines, deep inside their fortresses and redoubts. In order to gather them for our own technological progress, we must raid them and forcefully extract them. The Chimera seems to amass them too, for purposes yet to be understood… we can not allow them to outmatch us. Major Richard Blake, with the direct authorization by President McCullen, has approved the creation of an elite task force with the explicit purpose of infiltration, gathering, recovery, protection and application of these alien tech assets. The best members of the SRPA Advanced Tactical Operations were called to join the {ALT}Spectre Team{ALT}."


  STR_GRAY_TECH_INTRODUCTION: "Gray Tech' Introduction"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "“Gray Tech” (GT) is a term recently coined by Dr. Malikov to name the previously unknown alien tech, built or assembled by a third, undisclosed faction. More research is needed on the matter, to understand it and how it could be used in the war effort."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_THEORY: "Gray Tech Theory"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: "A growing theoretical approach on the extraterrestrial pieces point to certain physical and energetic characteristics that could be used on our own technology, as some kind of “booster” or improvement. The GT is shown capable of transmitting large amounts of energy, which is further increased by the addition of more of those items. If we continue researching more Gray Tech, we could refine a practical use for our troops on the field."

  STR_GRAY_TECH_APPLICATIONS: "Gray Tech Applications"
  STR_GRAY_TECH_APPLICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "The continued investigation on the matter has finally led to something very much needed for our military forces: weapons. By adding small amounts of GT to already existent human-designed energy weapons (often incorporating alien assets), we could greatly improve them. Other developments like craft energy weapons are planned as well. We must continue to work on the recovered extraterrestrial samples."

  STR_PROJECT_PROMETHEUS: "Project Prometheus"
  STR_PROJECT_PROMETHEUS_UFOPEDIA: "Dr. Julia Cathcart has taken the lead on the investigation on alien technology. She has theorized the Gray Tech individual items all belong to a larger mechanism or machine, taking in account how the emitted electromagnetic radiation becomes more and more intense with a larger number of GT pieces nearby one from another. We must continue researching this topic to refine our understanding."

  STR_PROMETHEUS_WEAPON: "Prometheus Weapon"
  STR_PROMETHEUS_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "A groundbreaking development by Dr. Cathcart”s team was made on the investigation. It confirmed the theory about how each GT item was a piece of a larger puzzle. By adding more and more items, more intense electromagnetic radiation is emitted, which could be used as a high yield explosive device. It is believed by combining 100 pieces, a powerful bomb could be assembled, which could cause a major blackout in the Chimera hub network. We must assemble it as soon as possible, as we have intel on the leader of the enemy, Daedalus, who seems to pursue a similar objective as us with the purpose of wiping out mankind, instead. Once the bomb is ready, we could prepare an offensive to deploy it."

  STR_OPERATION_OLYMPIC_DEPENDENCY: "Operation Olympic Dependency"

  STR_LAUNCH_OPERATION_OLYMPIC: "Launch Operation Olympic" 
  STR_LAUNCH_OPERATION_OLYMPIC_UFOPEDIA: "A major planning is done for the mission to infiltrate the very first Hub Tower: Tunguska. Site of the initial landing of the Chimera in 1908, it is believed to be the source of the alien corruption. A major coordinate strike to deliver Dr. Cathcart”s bomb against it will result in a domino effect - one by one, each Hub Tower will fall, and the whole grid with it. Once ready, click on the TUNGUSKA button to begin the final mission."

# LORE


  STR_JET_POWER_LORE: "Jet Power"
  STR_JET_POWER_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Germany put a strong emphasis on newer and better propulsion methods for aircraft. The fear of high-altitude Russian bombers led to the development of Me-262, the first successful jet-powered fighter. Officially deployed  in 1942, it became the premier interceptor force of the UED. Soon after, the British and Americans rushed their own projects, but were always behind the Luftwaffe's designs. The era of the piston-powered aircrafts was coming to an end."

  STR_FALLEN_KNIGHTS_LORE: "Fallen Knights"
  STR_FALLEN_KNIGHTS_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Despite the German air prowess, most of the Luftwaffe and the European air forces were quickly destroyed with the initial stages of the Chimeran onslaught. In the East, many pilots didn't even get to board their planes, as Spire missiles blanketed all the military bases they found on their pass. Western European squadrons fared slightly better and some air victories were scored over the Benelux. UED fighter wings were decimated by the extensive numbers of Chimeran combat crafts. The so-called 'Knights of the Air' were reduced to molten wrecks."

  STR_UED_FORCES_LORE: "UED Forces"
  STR_UED_FORCES_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "The bulk of the United European Defense forces were composed of French, Polish, Germans and Italians, plus reduced brigades from smaller countries. Equipped with German cutting-edge equipment, it was trained to fend off Russian mass-wave attacks. However, the UED's reliance on static defenses and trench warfare ala Great War made it poorly suited to the Chimeran mechanized breakthroughs. Political infighting and low morale shattered the alliance even before the enemy reached their borders."


  STR_ACES_HIGH_LORE: "Aces High"
  STR_ACES_HIGH_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Opposed to most European powers, the Royal Air Force focused primarily on a large fleet of efficient Kingfisher VTOLs to project airpower further inland. Despite being in development since 1937, it was only after the announcement of the Me-262 in the '42 that the Fighter Command opted to replace its fleet of Spitfires with the Meteor. Although slower and less armed than most of its peers, the Gloster-made fighter had a longer operational range. As most were lost in sorties over Czechoslovakia in support of the Bratislava Line, the last remaining few were engaged in air defense on Britain."

  STR_MAGNIFICENT_LIGHTNING_LORE: "Magnificent Lightning"
  STR_MAGNIFICENT_LIGHTNING_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "Despite the lack of sufficient aerial opposition during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy requested the development of a high-performance, high-altitude combat craft with the explicit purpose of engaging enemy bombers. The need to protect the main islands from foreign aggression motivated the project. The result was the J7W Shinden, a heavily armored and up-gunned craft. When the Chimera began pushing towards the Far East, even the Mitsubishi 'Zero' fighters struggled to keep the enemy crafts at bay and the Shinden became the elite naval interceptor."


  STR_EURO_AMERICAN_COLLABORATION_LORE: "Euro-American Collaboration"
  STR_EURO_AMERICAN_COLLABORATION_LORE_UFOPEDIA: "During the Roosevelt administration, there was a notorious diplomatic approach between the European organizations and the US. This led to several technological and technical agreements between both blocs, among them the “Strategic Ammunition Standardization Agreement (SATANAG)”, where the .303 British round was adopted as the general small arms chambering for all service rifles. Also, SRPA and MDC exchanged blueprints and research. This eventually became less public during the Grace Administration, as the diplomatic ties were strained with the growing US isolationism."

  
  STR_THE_TUNGUSKA_TOWER: "The Tunguska Tower"
  STR_THE_TUNGUSKA_TOWER_UFOPEDIA: "The Tower was the first ever Chimeran   STRucture to be excavated and it is believed to not only be the largest known tower but also be the Hub Tower of Russia and possibly Eastern Europe. Given it's unimaginable importance, it is extremely well protected; in fact, no one has ever got within 1,200 yards of the tower… except for Dr. Malikov, who managed to extract a Pure Chimera DNA sample directly in situ."

  STR_THE_SIBERIAN_GUARD: "The Siberian Guard"
  STR_THE_SIBERIAN_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "The Guard was established sometime in the early 40s, shortly after the fall of Imperial Russia and is often considered to be the last remnants of resistance in the Russian Far East. The Guard consists of three military bases spread out across Siberia, along with a single coastal village in the Pacific shoreline known as 'Provideniya', which houses several thousand Russian survivors. They take pride in being the sole protector of Siberia and have proven that through its ruthless guerrilla campaign against the Chimera."

  STR_VALERY_SABLIN: "Valery Sablin"
  STR_VALERY_SABLIN_UFOPEDIA: "A high ranking Russian Naval officer who was heavily involved in the evacuations of the Operation Kerensky, Once finished, he remained stationed on Wrangel Island until 1948, where he and his crew chose to leave the island on his ship, the 'Storozhevoy', planning on arriving at Alaska, However, due a lack of food, they were forced to dock in the coastal town of Provideniya, where they met the remnants of a Russian infantry division who had been stationed at the location. Instead of leaving for Alaska, Sablin and his crew choose to stay and fight for the Motherland. He quickly began to rise through the ranks and establish himself as leader after the untimely demise of the division's commanding officer. He would soon officially form the 'Siberian Guard'"

  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_1: "Operationi Kerensky"
  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_1_UFOPEDIA: "The operation, named after Premier Kerensky, was put in action in April 10th, 1930 as it became clear to the Russian Government that the military wouldn't be able to withstand the Chimera. It authorized the systematic evacuation of civilians into the islands of Sevemaya Zemlya, Novaya Zemlya, Wrangel Island and the New Siberian Islands. The evacuation was mostly handled by the Navy, with a minor role of the Russian Imperial Air Force."

  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_2: "Operationi Kerensky"
  STR_OPERATION_KERENSKY_2_UFOPEDIA: "Around 1,500,000 people were successfully extracted with operations still taking place as late as 1936. Despite escaping the Chimera, those who were evacuated didn't fare much better, as supply lines began to break down in 1937; a major shortage of food, medicine and other supplies caused famine and disease to run rampant in the poorly constructed camps that the refugees had been placed into."

  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_1: "The Yagoda Solution"
  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_1_UFOPEDIA: "Named after Chief Executive of the Secret Police, Genrikh Yagoda, was put into place some time after 1937 to prevent the Chimera from infecting anymore of the Russian population and eventually transforming them into the alien species. This would be done through humane termination of any civilians believed to be infected by the virus."

  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_2: "The Yagoda Solution"
  STR_YAGODA_SOLUTION_2_UFOPEDIA: "This would also extend to any civilian in enemy territory and eventually entire refugee camps if they were deemed too difficult to protect. The mass killings caused heavy distrust and even fear between the Russian people and the military. The Yagoda Solution would remain in effect from 1937 until the end of the war, resulting in nearly 4 million deaths and would be unsuccessful in stopping the Chimera."
